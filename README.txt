Provides JDBC 4 components not available in Java 5.
Based on Apache Harmony code, and distributed under Apache 2.0 license.

This library has been used by Apache Cayenne prior to version 3.2, which
is JDK 1.6+ and no longer requires special handling of JDBC 4 APIs.

As of now, the 'jdbc4-compat' library can be considered legacy.
