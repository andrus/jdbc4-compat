Provides JDBC 4 components not available in Java 5.
Based on Apache Harmony code, and distributed under Apache 2.0 license.

This library has been used by Apache Cayenne prior to version 3.2. 
3.2 and newer versions of Cayenne work on JDK 1.6+ and no longer require 
special handling of JDBC 4 APIs.

As a result 'jdbc4-compat' library can be considered legacy.
